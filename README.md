# World Weather Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to pull data from APIs and visualize it. This enables us to provide real-time recommendations for our client's ideal hotels. We first performed an API call with OpenWeatherMap to get weather information in different cities. We then used the Google Maps Directions API to create a travel route and a marker layer map.
